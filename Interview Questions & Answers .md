# 🟢 Beginner Level Questions

## **1. What is Six Sigma?**
Six Sigma is a data-driven methodology focused on reducing defects and minimizing variation using statistical tools.  
The goal is to achieve **3.4 defects per million opportunities (DPMO)**.

---

## **2. What is Lean?**
Lean focuses on eliminating waste (non–value-adding activities) to improve process flow, speed, and efficiency.

---

## **3. What are the 8 types of waste?**
TIMWOODS:  
- **T**ransport  
- **I**nventory  
- **M**otion  
- **W**aiting  
- **O**verproduction  
- **O**ver-processing  
- **D**efects  
- **S**kills (underutilized talent)

---

## **4. What is DMAIC?**
DMAIC = Define – Measure – Analyze – Improve – Control  
A structured problem-solving framework used for process improvement.

---

## **5. What is a SIPOC diagram?**
A high-level mapping tool showing:  
**S**uppliers – **I**nputs – **P**rocess – **O**utputs – **C**ustomers.

---

## **6. What is a Control Chart?**
A graphical tool used to monitor process variation over time and identify special-cause variations.

---

## **7. What are CTQs?**
Critical To Quality characteristics — measurable requirements that define customer expectations.

---

## **8. What is DPMO?**
Defects Per Million Opportunities.  
Used to quantify process performance in Six Sigma terms.

---

# 🟡 Intermediate Level Questions

## **9. What is Gage R&R?**
A Measurement System Analysis (MSA) tool that evaluates:  
- **Repeatability** (same operator, same measurement)  
- **Reproducibility** (different operators)

---

## **10. What is the difference between Defect and Defective?**
- **Defect** → A single flaw in a unit  
- **Defective** → A unit that has one or more defects and fails to meet CTQs

---

## **11. What is Process Capability?**
A statistical measure that shows how well a process meets specification limits.  
Uses indices like **Cp**, **Cpk**, **Pp**, **Ppk**.

---

## **12. What is Root Cause Analysis (RCA)?**
A structured method to identify the fundamental cause of a problem.  
Tools include 5-Why, Fishbone Diagram, Pareto Chart.

---

## **13. Explain FMEA.**
Failure Modes and Effects Analysis  
Used to identify failure points, evaluate risk through **RPN**, and prioritize corrective actions.

---

## **14. What is Hypothesis Testing?**
A statistical method to validate assumptions using sample data.  
Common tests: t-test, z-test, chi-square, ANOVA.

---

## **15. What is Regression Analysis?**
A statistical tool that determines the relationship between independent and dependent variables to identify key drivers.

---

## **16. Difference between Cp and Cpk?**
- **Cp**: Shows potential capability (ignores process centering)  
- **Cpk**: Shows actual capability (considers mean shift)

---

# 🔵 Advanced Level Questions

## **17. What is DOE (Design of Experiments)?**
An advanced statistical technique used to study multiple factors and their interactions simultaneously.  
Black Belts use DOE for optimization projects.

---

## **18. What is Multicollinearity in Regression?**
Occurs when independent variables are highly correlated.  
Causes unstable regression coefficients.  
Detected using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).

---

## **19. Explain ANOVA.**
Analysis of Variance — used to compare means across 2+ groups and determine if differences are statistically significant.

---

## **20. What is a p-value and its interpretation?**
p-value indicates the probability that observed results occurred by chance.  
- **p ≤ 0.05** → statistically significant  
- **p > 0.05** → fail to reject null hypothesis

---

## **21. What is the difference between Special Cause & Common Cause Variation?**
- **Common Cause**: Natural variation; predictable  
- **Special Cause**: Unusual variation; requires immediate investigation

---

## **22. How do you validate a Root Cause?**
Using **Hypothesis Testing**, Regression, F-test, DOE, or Control Charts to statistically confirm the cause.

---

## **23. Explain Logistic Regression.**
A regression technique used when the output variable is **binary** (yes/no, pass/fail, defect/no defect).

---

## **24. What is the purpose of a Control Plan?**
A detailed document designed to sustain improvements by tracking KPIs, control limits, reaction plans, and process ownership.

---

## **25. How do you reduce cycle time in a complex process?**
- VSM (Value Stream Mapping)  
- Bottleneck analysis  
- Line balancing  
- Work standardization  
- Automation opportunities  
- Lean flow principles  

---

## **26. How do Black Belts manage resistance to change?**
- Stakeholder mapping  
- Structured communication  
- Quick wins  
- Involvement of teams  
- Reinforcement using ADKAR / Kotter models  

---

## **27. How do you ensure financial validation in Six Sigma?**
- Use Cost of Poor Quality (COPQ)  
- Validate savings with Finance Team  
- Baseline vs Improved performance comparison  
- Realistic savings (hard + soft savings)

---

## **28. Explain MANOVA.**
Multivariate Analysis of Variance — used when multiple dependent variables are analyzed simultaneously.

---

## **29. How do you ensure sustainability of improvements?**
- Control charts  
- Audit schedules  
- Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)
